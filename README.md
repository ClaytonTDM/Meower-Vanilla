# Meower

Meower is a free, open-source, and nonprofit social media platform.

Meower-Vanilla is the original, Scratch-based client for Meower. It runs on TurboWarp and CloudLink Turbo. This version of the Meower Client is intended for use on Destkops and Laptops, and used as a reference for other clients.
